## 💻Technologies Used
- `React Native`: A JavaScript framework for building native mobile applications
- `Redux`: A state management library for managing application state.
- `React Navigation`: A routing and navigation library for handling navigation within the app.
- The code snippet fetches data from APIs. It utitlises the built-in `fetch` method in `JavaScript` to make an HTTP request and retrieve the data. The retrieved data is then sorted by the preferences before being sert in the component's state.
